## How to use?
Users are invited to search for their next furever friend by searching their zip code, type of animal (cat or dog), a specific breed, age preference, and gender preference. The users search can be very specific or broad and a list of available pets for adoption will be generated to show a thumbnail image and the name of the pet. Once the pet name is clicked, the chosen pets enlarged picture and detailed information will pop up to the side along with a map of the shelters location.
